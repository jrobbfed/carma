Spitzer 8~$\mu$m map toward Shell 34. Contours show $^{12}$CO integrated from 7.7 to 9.9~km~s$^{-1}$. Contours are drawn from 15 to 55$\sigma$ with steps of 10$\sigma$, where $\sigma = 0.9$~K~km~s$^{-1}$. The large solid circle and dashed annulus indicate the best-fit radius and thickness of the CO shell, respectively. White stars indicate intermediate-mass stars of spectral type B, A, and F. Cyan crosses indicate young stellar objects from the Spitzer Orion catalog.
