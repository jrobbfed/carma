Spitzer 8~$\mu$m map toward Shell 35. Contours show $^{13}$CO integrated from 7.0 to 9.1~km~s$^{-1}$. Contours are drawn from 30 to 50$\sigma$ with steps of 5$\sigma$, where $\sigma = 0.5$~K~km~s$^{-1}$. The large solid circle and dashed annulus indicate the best-fit radius and thickness of the CO shell, respectively. White stars indicate intermediate-mass stars of spectral type B, A, and F. Cyan crosses indicate young stellar objects from the Spitzer Orion catalog.
