Herschel-Planck dust temperature map toward Shell 23. Contours show $^{13}$CO integrated from 7.5 to 10.4~km~s$^{-1}$. Contours are drawn from 20 to 40$\sigma$ with steps of 5$\sigma$, where $\sigma = 0.6$~K~km~s$^{-1}$. The large solid circle and dashed annulus indicate the best-fit radius and thickness of the CO shell, respectively. White stars indicate intermediate-mass stars of spectral type B, A, and F. Cyan crosses indicate young stellar objects from the Spitzer Orion catalog.
