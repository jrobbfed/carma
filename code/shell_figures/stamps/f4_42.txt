Spitzer 8~$\mu$m map toward Shell 42. Contours show $^{12}$CO integrated from 6.1 to 8.0~km~s$^{-1}$. Contours are drawn from 17 to 26$\sigma$ with steps of 3$\sigma$, where $\sigma = 1.1$~K~km~s$^{-1}$. The large solid circle and dashed annulus indicate the best-fit radius and thickness of the CO shell, respectively. White stars indicate intermediate-mass stars of spectral type B, A, and F. Cyan crosses indicate young stellar objects from the Spitzer Orion catalog.
