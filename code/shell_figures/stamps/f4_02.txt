Spitzer 8~$\mu$m map toward Shell 2. Contours show $^{12}$CO integrated from 10.8 to 11.6~km~s$^{-1}$. Contours are drawn from 115 to 130$\sigma$ with steps of 3$\sigma$, where $\sigma = 0.3$~K~km~s$^{-1}$. The large solid circle and dashed annulus indicate the best-fit radius and thickness of the CO shell, respectively. White stars indicate intermediate-mass stars of spectral type B, A, and F. Cyan crosses indicate young stellar objects from the Spitzer Orion catalog.
