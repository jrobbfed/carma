Herschel-Planck dust temperature map toward Shell 37. Contours show $^{12}$CO integrated from 4.9 to 10.1~km~s$^{-1}$. Contours are drawn from 27 to 39$\sigma$ with steps of 4$\sigma$, where $\sigma = 2.1$~K~km~s$^{-1}$. The large solid circle and dashed annulus indicate the best-fit radius and thickness of the CO shell, respectively. White stars indicate intermediate-mass stars of spectral type B, A, and F. Cyan crosses indicate young stellar objects from the Spitzer Orion catalog.
