LAMBDA_R= 6562.7797852 #Wavelength of emission at rest in angstroms, only necessary if spectral dimension is not in velocity
CENTERING= 1 #whether to perform spectrum centering prior to fitting. It reorganizes the profile so the brightest point is in the center. Only valid for cycling range data such as Fabry-Perots (0=no,1=yes)
SMOOTH= 0 #set to 1 to perform gaussian smoothing of the cube prior to processing
